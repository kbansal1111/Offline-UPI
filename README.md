# UPI Offline Mesh — Node.js Version

A Node.js/Express backend that demonstrates **offline UPI payments routed through a Bluetooth-style mesh network**. This is a complete port of the original SpringBoot version to Node.js.

You're in a basement with zero connectivity. You send your friend ₹500. Your phone encrypts the payment, broadcasts it to nearby phones, and the packet hops device-to-device until *some* phone walks outside, gets 4G, and silently uploads it to this backend. The backend decrypts, deduplicates, and settles.

This repo is the **server side** of that system, plus a software simulator of the mesh so you can demo the whole flow on a single laptop without any real Bluetooth hardware.

## What this demo proves

The system shows three things working end to end:

1. **A payment can travel from sender to backend through untrusted intermediaries** without any of them being able to read or tamper with it. (Hybrid RSA + AES-GCM encryption.)
2. **Even if the same payment reaches the backend simultaneously through multiple bridge nodes, it settles exactly once.** (Idempotency via atomic compare-and-set on the ciphertext hash.)
3. **A tampered or replayed packet is rejected** before it touches the ledger.

You'll see all three in the dashboard.

---

## How to run it

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js 16 or newer** installed and on PATH. Check with `node -v`.
- That's it. No database, no Redis, no external dependencies beyond npm packages.

### Installation

```bash
cd UPI_NodeJS_Version
npm install
```

### Run the server

```bash
npm start
```

Or for development with auto-reload:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Open the dashboard

Once you see `UPI Offline Mesh Node.js server running on http://localhost:8080`, open:

**http://localhost:8080**

You'll get a dark dashboard with everything you need to drive the demo.

### Stop the server

`Ctrl+C` in the terminal.

---

## The demo flow (step by step)

The dashboard has four buttons that walk through the full pipeline. The intended sequence:

### Step 1 — Compose a payment

Choose sender, receiver, amount, PIN. Click **"📤 Inject into Mesh"**.

**What actually happens on the backend:**
- The server pretends to be the sender's phone.
- It builds a `PaymentInstruction` with a unique nonce and current timestamp.
- It encrypts that with the server's RSA public key (using hybrid encryption — see below).
- It wraps the ciphertext in a `MeshPacket` with a TTL of 5.
- It hands the packet to `phone-alice`, an offline virtual device.

You'll see `phone-alice` now holds 1 packet.

### Step 2 — Run gossip rounds

Click **"🔄 Run Gossip Round"**. Then click it again.

Each round, every device that holds a packet broadcasts it to every other device within "Bluetooth range" (which, in our simulator, means everyone). TTL decrements per hop.

After 1 round: every device holds the packet. After 2 rounds: still every device — TTL is just lower.

In the real system this would happen organically as people walk past each other in the basement.

### Step 3 — Bridge node walks outside

Click **"📡 Bridges Upload to Backend"**.

`phone-bridge` is the only device with `hasInternet=true`. The dashboard simulates that phone walking outside and getting 4G. It POSTs every packet it holds to `/api/bridge/ingest`.

The backend pipeline runs:
1. Hash the ciphertext (`SHA-256`).
2. Try to claim the hash in the idempotency cache.
3. If claimed: decrypt with the server's RSA private key.
4. Verify freshness (signedAt within 24 hours).
5. Run the debit/credit in a single DB transaction.

Watch the **Account Balances** table — money has moved. Watch the **Transaction Ledger** — a new row appears.

### Step 4 — Demonstrate idempotency (the killer feature)

Reset the mesh. Inject a single packet. Run gossip 2 times. Now **all 5 devices hold the same packet, including multiple bridges in a more complex setup**.

To really see idempotency in action:
1. Click "Inject" once.
2. Click "Gossip" twice.
3. Click "Flush Bridges" — only `phone-bridge` is a bridge in the default seed, so just one upload happens.

## The three hard problems and how they're solved

### Problem 1: Untrusted intermediates

A random stranger's phone is carrying your transaction. How do you stop them from reading the amount or changing it?

**Solution: Hybrid encryption (RSA-OAEP + AES-GCM).**

The sender encrypts the payload with the server's public key. Only the server holds the private key, so intermediates see opaque ciphertext.

But RSA can only encrypt small data (~245 bytes for a 2048-bit key), and our payload is JSON that could exceed that. So we use the standard hybrid pattern:

1. Generate a fresh AES-256 key for *this packet*.
2. Encrypt the JSON with **AES-256-GCM** (fast + authenticated).
3. Encrypt just the AES key with **RSA-OAEP**.
4. Concatenate: `[256 bytes RSA-encrypted AES key][12 bytes IV][AES ciphertext + 16-byte GCM tag]`.

**Why GCM specifically?** It's authenticated encryption. If an intermediate flips one bit anywhere in the ciphertext, decryption throws an exception — the GCM tag won't verify. The server cannot be tricked into processing tampered data.

This is the same scheme TLS uses. See `src/crypto/HybridCryptoService.js`.

### Problem 2: The duplicate-storm

Three bridge nodes hold the same packet. They all walk outside at the same instant. They all POST to `/api/bridge/ingest` within milliseconds of each other. If you naively process all three, the sender is debited ₹1500 instead of ₹500.

**Solution: Atomic compare-and-set on the ciphertext hash.**

The very first thing the server does on receiving a packet is compute `SHA-256(ciphertext)` and try to "claim" that hash:

```javascript
// IdempotencyService.js
ifseen.has(packetHash)) {
  return false; // duplicate
}
seen.set(packetHash, now);
return true; // first claimer
```

`Map.set` is atomic in Node.js. Even if 100 threads call it at the exact same nanosecond, exactly one returns true (the first claimer) and the rest return false. Only the first claimer proceeds to decrypt and settle. The rest are short-circuited as `DUPLICATE_DROPPED`.

**Why hash the ciphertext, not the packetId or the cleartext?**
- `packetId` can be rewritten by a malicious intermediate. Two copies of the same payment could have different packetIds. Bad key.
- The cleartext requires decryption first. We want to dedupe *before* spending CPU on RSA.
- The ciphertext is authenticated by GCM, so any tampering is detectable on decrypt. Two legitimate deliveries of the same payment have byte-identical ciphertexts (AES is deterministic for a given key+IV+plaintext, and the same packet means the same key+IV+plaintext).

In production this `Map` becomes Redis: `SET key NX EX 86400`. Same semantics, distributed across replicas.

There's also a defense-in-depth fallback: `transactions.packet_hash` has a unique index. If the cache layer ever fails and two settlements somehow try to write the same hash, the database rejects the second one.

### Problem 3: Replay attacks

An attacker who captured a ciphertext weeks ago could replay it whenever convenient.

**Solution: Two layers.**

1. **Inside the encrypted payload**, the sender includes `signedAt` (epoch millis). The server rejects any packet older than 24 hours. The attacker can't change `signedAt` without breaking the GCM tag.
2. **Inside the encrypted payload**, the sender includes a **nonce** (UUID). Even if Alice legitimately sends Bob ₹100 twice, the nonces differ → ciphertexts differ → hashes differ → both settle. But a *replay* of one specific signed packet is byte-identical, so the idempotency cache catches it.

See `BridgeIngestionService.js` for the freshness check.

## Differences from SpringBoot version

This Node.js version maintains the same architecture and functionality as the original SpringBoot version, with these technical differences:

- **Framework**: Express.js instead of Spring Boot
- **Database**: SQLite with Sequelize instead of H2 with JPA
- **Cryptography**: Node.js built-in `crypto` module instead of Java crypto APIs
- **Idempotency**: JavaScript `Map` instead of `ConcurrentHashMap`
- **Templating**: Static HTML instead of Thymeleaf
- **Transactions**: Sequelize transactions instead of Spring `@Transactional`

All core security features (hybrid encryption, idempotency, replay protection) are preserved.
